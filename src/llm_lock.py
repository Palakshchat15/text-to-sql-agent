"""Shared Ollama lock across the AI Engineer portfolio projects.

Before an Ollama-heavy job (generation eval, judge scoring) we create
AI_Engineer_Portfolio/.llm_lock holding the project name, PID and start time, and delete it
when the job ends (also on failure). If the file exists and belongs to another project, we wait
and poll. If it already belongs to this project (e.g. held by scripts/run_eval_queue.py around
a whole queue), the job proceeds and leaves the file for the holder to delete.
